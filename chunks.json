However , the amendments cumulatively point to prohibitions that were constant: (1) the prohibition applicable to such charities involved in carrying on activities \"in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering any service in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any other consideration\". (2) \"irrespective of the nature of use or application, or retention, of the income from such activity\" (i.e. activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business for a cess, fee or other consideration). By retrospective amendment, in section 2(15), after the proviso, a second proviso was inserted with effect from 1-4-2009. With the introduction of the second proviso, the resulting situation was that the first proviso (of exclusion of income through an activity as referred to) was inapplicable if the aggregate value of the receipts of such activity did not exceed Rs. 10,00,000, and later by Finance Act, 2012 - this was enhanced to Rs. 25,00,000.",

This is emphasized in the negative language employed by the main part of section 2(15). Therefore, the idea of a predominant object among several other objects, is discarded. The prohibition is relieved to a limited extent, by the proviso which carves out the condition by which otherwise prohibited activities can be engaged in by GPU charities. The conditions are: (a) That such activities in the nature of trade, commerce, business or service (in relation to trade, commerce or business for consideration) should be in the course of \"actual carrying on\" of the GPU object, and (b) The quantum of receipts from such activities should not exceed 20 per cent of the total receipts.

Such organisations and institutions12/16/25, 12:15 PM 9/92 are not limited to GPU category charities but rather extend to other types of charities (i.e. the per se kind as well). The controlling part of section 10(23C) along with the relevant clauses (iv) and (v) seek to exclude income received by the concerned charities. However , the provisos hedge such exemption with conditions. The seventh proviso - much like section 11(4A) and the definition - carve out an exception, to the exemptions such that income derived by charities from business, are not exempt. The seventh proviso virtually echoes section 11(4A) in that business income derived by a charity (in the present case, the GPU charities) which arises from an activity incidental to the attainment of its objective is not per se excluded.",

Yet, when the entity concerned charges substantial amounts- over and above the cost it incurs for doing the same work, or work which is part of its object (i.e., publishing an expensive coffee table book on Gandhi, or in the case of the marriage hall, charging significant amounts from those who can afford to pay, by providing extra services, far above the cost-plus nominal mark-up) such activities are in the nature of trade, commerce, business or service in relation to them.",

By way of illustration, if a corporation supplies essential food grains at cost, or a marginal mark-up, another supplies essential medicines, and a third, water , the characterization of these, as activities in the nature of business, would be self-defeating, because the overall receipts in some given cases may exceed the quantitative limit resulting in taxation and the consequent higher consideration char ged from the user or consumer .",

The Board ceased to enjoy exemption which it had hitherto, in the absence of the retrospective definition. It, therefore sought exemption, as a GPU category charity claiming that it was controlled by objects of general public utility having regard to the provisions of its parent Act, i.e., the Gujarat Maritime Board Act. This court refuted the argument of the revenue that if a corporation did not fall within the definition of \"local authority\" it could not claim to be a GPU charity . It was held that section 10(20) and section 11 of the 1961 Act operate in totally different spheres.

Indeed, in the reassessment proceedings for bringing to tax items which had escaped assessment, it would be open to an assessee to put forwar d claims for deduction of any expenditur e in respect of that income or the non-taxability of the items at all. Keeping in view the object and purpose of the proceedings under section 147 which are for the benefit of the revenue and not an assessee, an assessee cannot be permitted to convert the reassessment proceedings on his appeal or revision, in disguise, and seek relief in respect of items earlier rejected or claim relief in respect of items not claimed in the original assessment proceedings, unless relatable to 'escaped income', and reagitate the concluded matters. Even in cases wher e the claims of the assessee during the course of reassessment proceedings relating to the escaped assessment are accepted, still the allowance of such claims has to be limited to the extent to which they reduce the income to that originally assessed .",

The Tribunal was also right in concluding that the items which the assessee wanted to be taken into account in the proceedings under section 147 were unconnected with the escapement of incom e. The High Court clearly fell in error in holding otherwise.

CIT [1953] 23 ITR 82 (SC) the question as to the rights of an assessee to claim 'redoing', 'revising' or 'recomputing' entire income during the reassessment proceedings was left open, that question did not come up for consideration in the case of Dy. CCT v. H.R. Sri Ramulu [1977] 39 STC 177 (SC) or CST v. H.M. Esufali H.M. Abdulali [1973] 32 STC 77 (SC) or even in V. Jaganmohan Roa's case (supra ). Some of the High Courts, therefore, fell in error in reading those judgments, divorced from the context in which the precise questions came up for consideration in those cases, and to hold that the assessee could 'reagitate' the concluded issues and claim relief in respect of items, finally concluded in the original assessm ent proceedings, during the reassessment proceedings, unconnected with the escapement of income.",

With great regret, it has to be mentioned that these approvals are being granted mechanically and without application of mind and this is not the only matter . The approval has been granted in a most casual manner . The power vested in the Authorities under section 151 to grant or not to grant approval to the Assessing Officer to reopen the assessment is coupled with a duty.
