However , the amendments cumulatively point to prohibitions that were constant: (1) the prohibition applicable to such charities involved in carrying on activities \"in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering any service in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any other consideration\". (2) \"irrespective of the nature of use or application, or retention, of the income from such activity\" (i.e. activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business for a cess, fee or other consideration). By retrospective amendment, in section 2(15), after the proviso, a second proviso was inserted with effect from 1-4-2009. With the introduction of the second proviso, the resulting situation was that the first proviso (of exclusion of income through an activity as referred to) was inapplicable if the aggregate value of the receipts of such activity did not exceed Rs. 10,00,000, and later by Finance Act, 2012 - this was enhanced to Rs. 25,00,000.",

This is emphasized in the negative language employed by the main part of section 2(15). Therefore, the idea of a predominant object among several other objects, is discarded. The prohibition is relieved to a limited extent, by the proviso which carves out the condition by which otherwise prohibited activities can be engaged in by GPU charities. The conditions are: (a) That such activities in the nature of trade, commerce, business or service (in relation to trade, commerce or business for consideration) should be in the course of \"actual carrying on\" of the GPU object, and (b) The quantum of receipts from such activities should not exceed 20 per cent of the total receipts.

The controlling part of section 10(23C) along with the relevant clauses (iv) and (v) seek to exclude income received by the concerned charities. However , the provisos hedge such exemption with conditions. The seventh proviso - much like section 11(4A) and the definition - carve out an exception, to the exemptions such that income derived by charities from business, are not exempt. The seventh proviso virtually echoes section 11(4A) in that business income derived by a charity (in the present case, the GPU charities) which arises from an activity incidental to the attainment of its objective is not per se excluded.",

By way of illustration, if a corporation supplies essential food grains at cost, or a marginal mark-up, another supplies essential medicines, and a third, water , the characterization of these, as activities in the nature of business, would be self-defeating, because the overall receipts in some given cases may exceed the quantitative limit resulting in taxation and the consequent higher consideration char ged from the user or consumer .",

The Board ceased to enjoy exemption which it had hitherto, in the absence of the retrospective definition. It, therefore sought exemption, as a GPU category charity claiming that it was controlled by objects of general public utility having regard to the provisions of its parent Act, i.e., the Gujarat Maritime Board Act. This court refuted the argument of the revenue that if a corporation did not fall within the definition of \"local authority\" it could not claim to be a GPU charity . It was held that section 10(20) and section 11 of the 1961 Act operate in totally different spheres.

It is a matter of record that the materials for preparation of mid-day meal was supplied by the government. The assessee society claimed that it only obtains nominal charges for preparation of mid-day meals. The assessee's claim for registration was rejected on the ground that it was involved in commercial activity . Upon appeal, the Tribunal agreed with the assessee that supply of mid-day meals did not constitute business or commerce and that it promoted the objects of general public utility .",

            "para_id": "[Para 252]\nConclusion\n(iv) Summation of conclusions\nIn view of the foregoing discussion and analysis, the following conclusion s are recorded regarding the\ninterpretation of the changed definition of \"charitable purpose\" (with effect from 1-4-2009), as well as the\nlater amendments, and other related provisions of the IT  Act.\nA. General test under section 2  (15)\nA.1 It is clarified that an assessee advancing general public utility cannot engage itself in any trade, commerce\nor business, or provide service in relation thereto for any consideration (\"cess, or fee, or any other\nconsideration\");\nA.2 However , in the course of achieving the object of general public utility , the concerned trust, society , or\nother such organization, can carry on trade, commerce or business or provide services in relation thereto for\nconsideration, provided that (i) the activities of trade, commerce or business are connected (\"actual carrying12/16/25, 12:15 PM\n19/92\nout…\" inserted with effect from 1-4-2016) to the achievement of its objects of GPU; and (ii) the receipt from\nsuch business or commercial activity or service in relation thereto, does not exceed the quantified limit, of 20\nper cent of total receipts of the precious year;\nA.3 Generally , the charging of any amount towards consideration for such an activity (advancing general\npublic utility), which is on cost-basis or nominally above cost, cannot be considered to be \"trade, commerce,\nor business\" or any services in relation thereto. It is only when the charges are markedly or significantly above\nthe cost incurred by the assessee in question, that they would fall within the mischief of \"cess, or fee, or any\nother consideration\" towards \"trade, commerce or business\". In this regard, the Court has clarified through\nillustrations what kind of services or goods provided on cost or nominal basis would normally be excluded\nfrom the mischief of trade, commerce, or business, in the body of the judgment.\nA.4 Section 11(4A) must be interpreted harmoniously with section 2(15), with which there is no conflict.\nCarrying out activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or service in relation to such activities,\nshould be conducted in the course of achieving the GPU object, and the income, profit or surplus or gains\nmust, therefore, be incidental. The requi rement in section 11(4A) of maintaining  separate books of account is\nalso in line with the necessity of demonstrating that the quantitative limit prescribed in the proviso to section\n2(15), has not been breached. Similarly , the insertion of section 13(8), seventeenth proviso to section 10(23C)\nand third proviso to section 143(3) (all with retrospective effect from 1-4-2009), reaffirm this interpretation\nand bring uniformity across the statutory provisions.\nB. Authorities, corporations, or bodies established by statute\nB.1 The amounts or any money whatsoever charged by a statutory corporation , board or any other body set-\nup by the state government or central governments, for achieving what are essentially 'public\nfunctions/services' (such as housing, industrial development, supply of water , sewage management, supply of\nfood grain, development and town planning, etc.) may resemble trade, comm ercial, or business activities.\nHowever , since their objects are essential for advancement of public purposes/functions (and are accordingly\nrestrained by way of statutory provision s), such receipts are prima facie to be excluded from the mischief of\nbusiness or commercial receipts. This is in line with the larger bench judgments of this court in Shri Ramtanu\nCo-operative Housing Society Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra [1970] 3 SCC 323 and New Delhi Municipal\nCouncil  v. State of Punjab  [1977] 7 SCC 399 ( supra ).\nB.2 However , at the same time, in every case, the Assessing Officer would have to apply their minds and\nscrutinize the records, to determine if, and to what extent, the consideration or amounts charged are\nsignificantly higher than the cost and a nominal mark-up. If such is the case, then the receipts would indicate\nthat the activities are in fact in the nature of \"trade, commerce or business\" and as a result, would have to\ncomply with the quantified limit (as amended from time-to-time) in the proviso to section 2(15).\nB.3 In clause (b) of section 10(46) \"commercial\" has the same meaning as \"trade, commerce, business\" in\nsection 2(15). Therefore, sums charged by such notified body , authority , Board, Trust or Commission (by\nwhatever name called) will require similar consideration - i.e., whether it is at cost with a nominal mark-up or\nsignificantly higher , to determine if it falls within the mischief of \"commercial activity\". However , in the case\nof such notified bodies, there is no quantified limit in section 10(46). Therefore, the Central Government\nwould have to decide on a case-by-case basis whether and to what extent, exemption can be awarded to\nbodies that are notified under section 10(46).\nB.4 For the period 1-4-2003 to 1-4-201 1, a statutory corporation could claim the benefit of section 2(15)\nhaving regard to the judgment of this Court in the CIT v. Gujarat Maritime Boar d [2008] 166 Taxman\n58/[2007] 295 ITR 561/214 CTR 81 (SC)/[2007] 12 SCR 962/[2007] 14 SCC 704. Likewise, the denial of\nbenefit under section 10(46) after 1-4-20 11 does not preclude a statutory corporation, board, or whatever such\nbody may be called, from claiming that it is set-up for a charitable purpose and seeking exemption under\nsection 10(23C) or other provisions of the Act.\nC. Statutory regulators\nC.1 The income and receipts of statutory regulatory bodies which are for instance, tasked with exclusive\nduties of prescribing curriculum, disciplining professionals and prescribing standards of professional conduct,\nare prima facie not business or commercial receipts. However , this is subject to the caveat that if the\nAssessing Officer discern that certain kinds of activities carried out by such regulatory body involved\ncharging of fees that are significantly higher than the cost incurred (with a nominal mark-up) or providing12/16/25, 12:15 PM\n20/92\nother facilities or services such as admission forms, coaching classes, registr ation processing fees, etc., at\nmarkedly higher prices, those would constitute commercial or business receipts. In that event, the overall\nquantitative limit prescribed in the proviso to section 2(15) (as amended from time-to-time) has to be\ncomplied with, if the regulatory body is to be considered as one with 'charitable purpose' eligible for\nexemption under the IT  Act.\nC.2 Like statutory authorities which regulate professions, statutory bodies which certify products (such as\nseeds) based on standards for qualification, etc. will also be treated similarly .\nD. Trade promotion bodies\nBodies involved in trade promotion (such as AEPC), or set-up with the objects of purely advocating for, co-\nordinating and assisting trading organisations, can be said to be involved in advancement of objects of general\npublic utility . However , if such organisations provide additional services such as courses meant to skill\npersonnel, providing private rental spaces in fairs or trade shows, consulting services, etc. then income or\nreceipts from such activities, would be business or commercial in nature. In that event, the claim for tax\nexemption would have to be again subjected to the rigors of the proviso to section 2(15).\nE. Non-statutory bodies\nE.1 In the present batch of cases, non-statutory bodies performing public functions, such as ERNET  and NIXI\nare engaged in important public purposes. The materials on record show that fees or consideration charged by\nthem for the purposes provided are nominal. In the circumstances, it is held that the said two assessees are\ndriven by charitable purposes. However , the claims of such non-statutory organisations performing public\nfunctions, will have to be ascertained on a yearly basis, and the tax authorities must discern from the records,\nwhether the fees char ged are nominally above the cost, or have been increased to much higher levels.\nE.2 It is held that though GS1 India is in fact, involved in advancement of general public utility , its services\nare for the benefit of trade and business, from which they receive significantly high receipts. In the\ncircumstances, its claim for exemption cannot succeed having regard to amended section 2(15). However , the\nCourt does not rule out any future claim made and being independently assessed, if GS1 is able to satisfy that\nwhat it provides to its customers is char ged on cost-basis with at the most, a nominal markup.\nF. Sports associations\nSo far as the state cricket associations are concerned (Saurashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Baroda, and Rajkot). It\nis opined that the matter requires further scrutiny . Accordingly , a direction is issued that the Assessing Officer\nshall adjudicate the matter afresh after issuing notice to the concerned assessees and examining the relevant\nmaterial indicated in the previous paragraphs of this judgment. Furthermore, if any consequential order needs\nto be issued, the same shall be done and resulting actions, including assessment orders shall be passed in\naccordance with the law under relevant provisions of the IT  Act.\nG. Private T rusts\nSo far as the appeal by assessee-T ribune Trust is concerned, it has been held that despite advancing general\npublic utility , the trust cannot benefit from exemption offered to entities covered by section 2(15) as the\nrecords reveal that income received from advertisements, constituted business or commercial receipts.\nConsequently , the limit prescribed in the proviso to section 2(15) has to be adhered to for the Trust's claim of\nbeing as a charity eligible for exemption, to succeed. Therefore, despite differing reasoning, this court has\nheld that the impugned judgment of the High Court does not call for interference.\nH. Application of interpretation\nH. It may be noted that the conclusions arrived at by way of this judgment, neither precludes any of the\nassessees (whether statutory , or non-statutory) advancing objects of general public utility , from claiming\nexemption, nor the taxing authorities from denying exemption, in the future, if the receipts of the relevant\nyear exceed the quantitative limit. The Assessing Officer must on a yearly basis, scrutinize the record to\ndiscern whether the nature of the assessee's activities amount to 'trade, commerce or business' based on its\nreceipts and income (i.e., whether the amounts charged are on cost-basis, or significantly higher). If it is found\nthat they are in the nature of 'trade, commerce or business', then it must be examined whether the quantified\nlimit (as amended from time-to-time) in proviso to section 2(15), has been breached, thus, disentitling them to\nexemption.
