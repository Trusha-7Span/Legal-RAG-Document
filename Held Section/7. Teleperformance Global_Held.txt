■ The ground raised by the petitioner that the sanction/approval under Section 151 has been obtained and
granted without application of mind is to be agreed with. A copy of the approval and impugned order
under Section 148A( d) are annexed to the petition. In column  7 of the approval, the quantum of income
which has escaped assessment is mentioned as Rs.63,16,784/-. In column 18, reasons for the belief that
income has escaped assessment is answered as, “Refer order under section 148A( d) for details”. The
Additional/Joint Commissioner of Income Tax has recommended the issuance of notice under section 148.
[Para 6]
■ The draft of the order under section 148A( d) in paragraph 7 states that income of Rs.97,06,91 1/- has
escaped assessment within the meaning of provision of Section 147 and the same is required to be
examined. If the AO who had sought the approval, the Additional/Joint CIT, who had recommended grant
of approval and the Principal Commis sioner , who granted the approval had only bothered to read the
request for approval along with draft of the order under Section 148A( d), they would have certainly
noticed the discrepancies. It is, therefore, clear that none of these officers have even bothered to read the
request for approval or draft of the order . In the affidavit in reply , it is mentione d as a typographical error .
This explanation cannot be accepted because a typographical error could have been committed by the AO,
who was seeking the approval, but if only the Additional/Joint CIT or the Principal Commissioner had
read the approval application and the draft of the order to be issued under Section 148A( d), they would
have certainly noticed the discrepancy and they should have either refused approval or sent the application
back to the AO for filing correct form for approval.[Para 7]
■ In the circumstances, this is a fit case seeking interference of this Court. Thus, the order dated 31-3-2023
under Clause (d) of Section 148A  is hereby , quashed. The consequent notice issued under Section 148
also dated 31-3-2023 is also quashed and set aside.[Para 8]
