Reading T OLA  into the Income-tax Act
■ The ingredients of the first proviso to section 149(1)( b) could be broken down for analysis as follows :
(i) no notice under section 148 of the new regime can be issued at any time for an assessment year
beginning on or before 1-4-2021;12/16/25, 11:59 AM
2/43
(ii) if it is barred at the time when the notice  is sought to be issued because of the "time limits specified
under the provisions of" section 149(1)( b) of the old regime.
Thus, a notice could be issued under section 148 of the new regime for assessment year 2021-22 and before
only if the time limit for issuance of such notice continued to exist under section 149(1)( b) of the old regime.
[Para 46]
■ Notices have to be judged according to the law existing on the date the notice is issued. Section 149 of the
old regime primarily provided two time limits:
(i) four years for all situations and
(ii) beyond four years and within six years if the income chargeable to tax which escaped assessment
amounted to Rupees one lakh or more.
After 1-4-2021, the time limits prescrib ed under the new regime came into force. The ordinary time limit of
four years was reduced to three years. Therefore, in all situations, reassessment notices could be issued under
the new regime if not more than three years have elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment year. [Para
48]
■ The first proviso to section 149(1)( b) requires the determination of whethe r the time limit prescribed
under section 149(1)( b) of the old regime continues to exist for the assessment year 2021-22 and before.
Resultantly , a notice under section 148 of the new regime cannot be issued if the period of six years from
the end of the relevant assessment year has expired at the time of issuance of the notice. This also ensures
that the new time limit of ten years prescribed under section 149(1)( b) of the new regime applies
prospectively . Without the proviso to section 149(1)( b) of the new regime, the Revenue could  have had
the power to reopen assessments for the year 2012-13 if the escaped assessment amounted to Rs. 50 lakhs
or more. The proviso limits the retrospective operation of section 149(1)( b) to protect the interests of the
assessees. [Para 49]
■ Another important change under section 149(1)( b) of the new regime is the increase in the monetary
threshold from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 50 lakhs. The old regime prescribed a time limit of six years from the end
of the relevant assessment year if the income chargeable to tax which escaped assessment was more than
Rs. 1 lakh. In comparison, the new regime increases the time limit to ten years if the escaped assessment
amounts to more than Rs. 50 lakhs. [Para 50]
■ Given section 149(1)( b) of the new regime, reassessment notices could be issued after three years only if
the income chargeable to tax which escaped assessment is more than Rs. 50 lakhs. The proviso to section
149(1)( b) limits the retrospectivity of that provision with respect to the time limits specif ied under section
149(1)( b) of the old regime. [Para 51]
TOLA  can extend the time limit till 31-6-2021
■ TOLA  extended the time limits for completion or compliance of certain actions under the specified Act,
which fell for completion during the COVID-19 outbreak. The use of the expression 'any' in section 3(1)
indicates that the relaxation applies to 'all' or 'every' action whose time limit falls for completion from 20-
3-2020 to 31-3-2021. Section 3(1) is only concerned with the performance of actions contemplated under
the provisions of the specified Acts. Consequently , the amendment or substitution of a provision under the
specified Acts will not affect the application of TOLA, so long as the action contemplated under the
provision falls for completion during the period specified by TOLA, that is, 20-3-2020 to 31-3-2021.
[Para 63]
■ After 1-4-2021, the Income-tax Act has to be read along with the substituted provisions. The substituted
provisions apply retrospectively for past assessment years as well. On 1-4-2021, TOLA  was still in
existence, and the revenue could not have ignored the application of TOLA  and its notifications.
Therefore, for issuing a reassessment notice under section 148 after 1-4-2021, the revenue would still
have to look at: (i) the time limit specified under section 149 of the new regime; and (ii) the time limit for
issuance of notice as extended by TOLA  and its notifications. The revenue cannot extend the operation of
the old law under TOLA, but it can certainly benefit from the extended time limit for completion of
actions falling for completion between 20-3-2020 and 31-3-2021. [Para 68]12/16/25, 11:59 AM
3/43
■ For instance, section 149(1)( a) of the new regime specified the time limit of three years from the end of
the relevant assessment year for reopeni ng of the assessment. For assessment year 2017-18, the three year
period expired on 31-3-2021. The expir y of time fell within the time period contemplated by section 3 of
TOLA  read with its notifications. Resultantly , the revenue had time until 30-6-2021 to issue a
reassessment notice for assessment year 2017-18 under section 149(1)( a). This harmonious reading gives
effect to the legislative intention of both the Income-tax Act and TOLA. Moreover , sections 147 to 151
are machinery provisions. Therefore, they must be given an interpretation that is consistent with the object
and purpose of the Income-tax Act. [Para 69]
■ Section 3(1) of TOLA  contains a non obstante  clause: 'notwithstanding anything contained in the
specified Act.' The legislative intention of including the non obstante  clause is to remove any obstacles
which may come in the way of the operation of the extension of the time limit till 31-3-2021 or such other
date after 31-3-2021 specified by the Central Government. The purpose is to ensure that the full benefit of
the relaxation should be provided to both the assessee and the Revenue to tide over the difficulties caused
by the COVID-19 pandemic. [Para 71]
■ The non obstante  clause in section 3(1) has to be read as controlling the provisions of the specif ied Acts,
including the provisions of the Income-tax Act. In the context of the issuance of a reassessment notice, the
non obstante  clause will override the provisions of the Income-tax Act in case of any direct conflict or
inconsistency . Section 3(1) overrides section 149 only to the extent of relaxing the time limit for issuance
of reassessment notice under section 148. The time limit for issuance of a reassessment notices, which fall
for completion between 20-3-2020 and 31-3-2021, has been extended till 30-6-2021. However , the non
obstante  clause under section 3(1) of TOLA  will operate neither to extend the time limit of three years
from the end of the relevant assessment year under section 149(1)( a) of the new regime nor to extend the
time limit of six years from the end of the relevant assessment years under section 149(1)( b) of the old
regime. The non obstante  clause ensures that the revenue has additional time beyond the statutory
stipulated time limit to complete or comply with the formalities given the administrative difficulties that
arose due to the COVID-19 pandemic. [Para 72]
Sanction of the specified authority
■ After 1-4-2021, the new regime has specified different authorities for granting sanctions under section
151. The new regime is beneficial to the assessee because it specifies a higher level of authority for the
grant of sanctions in comparison to the old regime. Therefore, in terms of Union of India  v. Ashish
Agarwal [2022] 138 taxmann.com 64/286 Taxman 183/444 ITR 1 (SC) , after 1-4-2021, the prior approval
must be obtained from the appropriate authorities specified under section 151 of the new regime. [Para
75]
■ Grant of sanction by the appropriate authority is a pre-condition for the Assessing Officer to assume
jurisdiction under section 148 to issue a reassessment notice. Section 151 of the new regime does not
prescribe a time-limit within which a specified authority has to grant sanction. Rather , it links up the time
limits with the jurisdiction of the authority to grant sanction. Section 151(ii) of the new regime prescribes
a higher level of authority if more than three years have elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment
year. Thus, non-compliance by the Assessing Officer with the strict time limits  prescribed under section
151 af fects their jurisdiction to issue a notice under section 148. [Para 76]
■ The Parliament enacted TOLA  to ensure that the interests of the revenue are not defeated because the
Assessing Officer could not comply with the pre-conditions due to the difficulties that arose during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Section 3(1) of TOLA  relaxes the time-limit for compli ance with actions that fall
for completion from 20-3-2020 to 31-3-2021. TOLA  will accordingly extend the time-limit for the grant
of sanction by the authority specified under section 151. The test to determine whether TOLA  will apply
to section 151 of the new regime is this: if the time-limit of three years from the end of an assessment year
falls between 20-3-2020 and 31-3-2021, then the specified authority under section 151(i) has an extended
time till 30-6-2021 to grant approval. In the case of section 151 of the old regim e, the test is: if the time-
limit of four years from the end of an assessment year falls between 20-3-202 0 and 31-3-2021, then the
specified authority under section 151(2) has time till 31-3-2021 to grant approval. The time-limit for
section 151 of the old regime expires on 31-3-2021 because the new regime comes into effect on 1-4-
2021. [Para 77]12/16/25, 11:59 AM

The Scope of Ashish Agarwal extended  to all the reassessment notices issued between 1-4-2021 and 30-6-
2021 under the old regime
■ In Ashish Agarwal  (supra ), this Court: (i) upheld the judgments of the High Courts; and (ii) deemed the
notices issued under section 148 of the old regime as show cause notices issued under section 148A( b) of
the new regime. By agreeing with the judgments of the High Courts, this Court laid down the law that the
provisions of the new regime will be applicable for all the reassessment notices issued under section 148
after 1-4-2021. As a result of this holdi ng, all the reassessment notices issued in terms of section 148 of
the old regime would have been declared invalid. Therefore, this Court deemed the reassessment notices
issued under the old regime after 1-4-2021 as show cause notices issued under section 148A( b) of the new
regime. [Para 89]
Effect of the legal fiction created in Ashish Agarwal (supra)
■ Before proceeding, it is important to bear in mind three important periods:
i. The period up to 30-6-2021 - this perio d is covered by the provisions of the Income-tax Act read
with TOLA;
ii. The period from 1-7-2021 to 3-5-2022 - the period before the decision of this Court in Ashish
Agarwal  (supra ); and
iii. The period after 4-5-2022 - the period after the decision of this Court in Ashish Agarwal  (supra ).
This period is covered by the directions issued by this Court in Ashish Agarwal  (supra ) and the
provisions of the Income-tax Act read with TOLA. [Para 94]
■ In Ashish Agarwal  (supra ), this Court created a legal fiction by deeming the section 148 notices issued
under the old regime as show cause notices under section 148A( b) of the new regime. The purpose of the
legal fiction was to enable the revenue 'to proceed further with the reassessment proceedings as per the
substituted provisions' of the Income-tax Act. Accordingly , all the reassessment notices issued under the
old regime were deemed to always have been show cause notices issued under section 148A( b) of the new
regime. The fiction replaced section 148 notices with section 148A( b) notices with effect from the date
when the notices under section 148 of the old regime were issued between 1-4-2021 and 30-6-2021, as the
case may be. This ensured the continuance of the reassessment process initiated by the revenue from 1-4-
2021 to 30-6-2021 under the old regime. [Para 99]
■ Importantly , this Court in Ashish Agarwal  (supra ) did not quash the reassessment notices issued under
section 148 of the old regime. [Para 100]
■ The combined effect of the legal fiction and the directions issued by this Court in Ashish Agarwal  (supra )
is that the show cause notices that were deemed to have been issued during the period between 1-4-2021
and 30-6-2021 were stayed till the date of supply of the relevant information and material by the
Assessing Officer to the assessee. After the supply of the relevant material and information to the
assessee, time begins to run for the assessees to respond to the show cause notices. [Para 106]
■ The third proviso to section 149 allows the exclusion of time allowed for the assessees to respond to the
show cause notice under section 149A( b) to compute the period of limitation. The third proviso excludes
'the time or extended time allowed to the assessee.' Resultantly , the entire time allowed to the assessee to
respond to the show cause notice has to be excluded for computing the period of limitation. In Ashish
Agarwal  (supra ), this Court provided two weeks to the assessees to reply to the show cause notices. This
period of two weeks is also liable to be excluded from the computation of limitation given the third
proviso to section 149. Hence, the total time that is excluded for computation of limitation for the deemed
notices is: (i) the time during which the show cause notices were effectively stayed, that is, from the date
of issuance of the deemed notice between 1-4-2021 and 30-6-2021 till the supply of relevant information
or material by the Assessing Officers to the assessees in terms of the directions in Ashish Agarwal  (supra );
and ( ii) two weeks allowed to the assessees to respond to the show cause notices. [Para 107]
Interplay of Ashish Agarwal (supra) with T OLA
■ The Income-tax Act read with TOLA  extended the time-limit for issuing reassessment notices under
section 148, which fell for completion from 20-3-2020 to 31-3-2021, till 30-6-2021. All the reassessment12/16/25, 11:59 AM
5/43
notices under challenge in the present appeals were issued from 1-4-2021 to 30-6-2021 under the old
regime. Ashish Agarwal  (supra ) deemed these reassessment notices under the old regime as show cause
notices under the new regime with effect from the date of issuance of the reasse ssment notices. The effect
of creating the legal fiction is that this Court has to imagine as real all the consequences and incidents that
will inevitably flow from the fiction. Therefore, the logical effect of the creation of the legal fiction by
Ashish Agarwal  (supra ) is that the time surviving under the Income-tax Act read with TOLA  will be
available to the revenue to complete the remaining proceedings in furtheranc e of the deemed notices,
including issuance of reassessment notices under section 148 of the new regime. The surviving or balance
time-limit can be calculated by computing the number of days between the date of issuance of the deemed
notice and 30-6-2021. [Para 108]
■ If this Court had not created the legal fiction and the original reassessment notices were validly issued
according to the provisions of the new regime, the notices under section 148 of the new regime would
have to be issued within the time-limits extended by TOLA. As a corollary , the reassessment notices to be
issued in pursuance of the deemed notices must also be within the time-limit surviving under the Income-
tax Act read with TOLA. This construction gives full effect to the legal fiction created in Ashish Agarwal
(supra ) and enables both the assessees and the revenue to obtain the benefit of all consequences flowing
from the fiction. [Para 109]
■ The effect of the creation of the legal fiction in Ashish Agarwal  (supra ) was that it stopped the clock of
limitation with effect from the date of issuance of section 148 notices under the old regime [which is also
the date of issuance of the deemed notices]. As discussed in the preceding segm ents of this judgment, the
period from the date of the issuance of the deemed notices till the supply of relevant information and
material by the Assessing Officers to the assessees in terms of the directions issued by this Court in Ashish
Agarwal  (supra ) has to be excluded from the comput ation of the period of limitation. Moreover , the
period of two weeks granted to the assessees to reply to the show cause notices must also be excluded in
terms of the third proviso to section 149. [Para 1 10]
■ The clock started ticking for the revenue only after it received the response of the assessees to the show
causes notices. After the receipt of the reply , the Assessing Officer had to perform the following
responsibilities:
i. consider the reply of the assessee under section 149A( c);
ii. take a decision under section 149A( d) based on the available material and the reply of the assessee;
and
iii. issue a notice under section 148 if it was a fit case for reassessment.
Once the clock started ticking, the Assessing Officer was required to complet e these procedures within the
surviving time-limit. The surviving time-limit, as prescribed under the Income-tax Act read with TOLA, was
available to the Assessing Officers to issue the reassessment notices under section 148 of the new regime.
[Para 1 11]
■ In the instant appeals, the reassessment notices pertain to the assessment years 2013-14 to 2017-18. To
assume jurisdiction to issue notices under section 148 with respect to the relevant assessment years, an
Assessing Officer has to: (i) issue the notices within the period prescribed under section 149(1) of the new
regime read with TOLA; and (ii) obtain the previous approval of the authority specified under section
151. A notice issued without complying with the pre-conditions is invalid as it affects the jurisdiction of
the Assessing Officer. Therefore, the reassessment notices issued under section 148 of the new regime,
which are in pursuance of the deemed notices, ought to be issued within the time-limit surviving under the
Income-tax Act read with TOLA. A reassessment notice issued beyond the surviving time-limit will be
time-barred. [Para 1 13]
Conclusions
■ In view of the above discussion, it is concluded that :
(a) After 1-4-2021, the Income-tax Act has to be read along with the substituted provisions;12/16/25, 11:59 AM
6/43
(b) TOLA  will continue to apply to the Income-tax Act after 1-4-2021 if any action or proceeding
specified under the substituted provisions of the Income-tax Act falls for completion between 20-3-
2020 and 31-3-2021;
(c) Section 3(1) of TOLA  overrides section 149 only to the extent of relaxing the time-limit for
issuance of a reassessment notice under section 148;
(d) TOLA  will extend the time-limit for the grant of sanction by the authority specified under section
151. The test to determine whether TOLA  will apply to section 151 of the new regime is this: if the
time-limit of three years from the end of an assessment year falls between 20-3-2020 and 31-3-
2021, then the specified authority under section 151(i) has extended time till 30-6-2021 to grant
approval;
(e) In the case of section 151 of the old regime, the test is: if the time-limit of four years from the end
of an assessment year falls between 20-3-2020 and 31-3-2021, then the specified authority under
section 151(2) has extended time till 31-3-2021 to grant approval;
(f) The directions in Ashish Agarwal  (supra ) will extend to all the ninety thousan d reassessment
notices issued under the old regime during the period 1-4-2021 and 30-6-2021;
(g) The time during which the show cause notices were deemed to be stayed is from the date of
issuance of the deemed notice between 1-4-2021 and 30-6-2021 till the supply of relevant
information and material by the Assessin g Officers to the assessees in terms of the directions issued
by this Court in Ashish Agarwal  (supra ), and the period of two weeks allowed  to the assessees to
respond to the show cause notices; and
(h) The Assessing Officers were required to issue the reassessment notice under section 148 of the new
regime within the time-limit surviving under the Income-tax Act read with TOLA. All notices
issued beyond the surviving period are time barred and liable to be set aside. [Para 1 14]
