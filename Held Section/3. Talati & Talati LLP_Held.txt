HELD
 
■ Section 148 is a procedure provided for issuance of notice in all cases of assess ment, re-assessment or re-
computation under section 147, which empowers the Assessing Officer to assess and reassess where any
income chargeable to tax, in the case of an assessee, who has escaped assessmen t for any assessment year,
subject to the provisions of sections 148 to 153. It may also be useful to note that section 148A  inserted by
the Finance Act, 2021 with effect from 1-4-2021 provides for inquiry , opportunity of hearing to the
assessee before issuance of notice under section 148. [Para 20]
■ A reading of the proviso to section 148A  shows that the requirements to conduct an inquiry with the prior
approval of the specified authority; provide opportunity of hearing to the asses see; consider reply of the
assessee furnished in response to the show-cause notice; and decide on the basis of the material available
on record including reply to the assessee, whether or not the case is fit to issue a notice under section 148,
by passing an order , is not applicable in a case of search and seizure under section 132. The proviso will
be attracted in a case where the Assessin g Officer on the information received by him as a result of search
under section 132, or requisitioned under section 132A, is satisfied, with the prior approval of the
Principal Commissioner or Commissioner that any money , bullion etc., or any books of
account/documents etc. seized in a searc h under section 132 or requisitioned under section 132A; in case
of any other person on or after 1-4-2021, belongs to, pertain(s) to; or any information contained therein,
relate to, the assessee. [Para 21]
■ From a further reading of Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 attached to section 148, it is clear that the
provisions under section 148 for issuance of notice before making assessment, re-assessment or re-
computation under section 147 operate in two dif ferent ways. [Para 22]
■ The provisions contained in Explanation 1 shows that the information with the Assessing Officer for the
purpose of section 148, which suggests  that the income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment under
the Explanation would mean: (i) any information in the case of the assessee, for the relevant assessment
year, in accordance with the risk management strategy formulated by the Board from time to time; or (ii)
any audit objection to the effect that the assessment in the case of the assessee for the relevant assessment
year has not been made in accordance with the provisions of this Act; or (iii) any information received
under an agreement referred to in section 90 or section 90A; or (iv) any informa tion made available to the
Assessing Officer under the scheme notified under section 135A; or (v) any information which requires
action in consequence of the order of a Tribunal or a Court. On the contrary , Explanation 2 which deals
with the information received during search and seizure operations under section 132 requires fulfilment
of pre-requisites conditions, noted hereinbefore, in the submission of the revenue. [Para 23]
■ The concept of Risk Management Strategy formulated by the Board is incorporated in Clause (i) of
Explanation 1, as also specified in Clause 3 of the notification dated 29-3-2022 issued by the Central
Government in accordance with the provisions of Explanation 1 clause (i) to section 148, which is not
applicable in the case of information received during the course of search and seizure under section 132.
[Para 24]
■ From the language employed in the Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 to section 148, it is opined that the
method of automated allocation, i.e. for random allocation of cases throug h algorithm, or by using
suitable technological tools, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, in accordance with risk
management strategy formulated by the Board, as referred to in Explanation 1 clause (i) to section 148,
for issuance of notice under section 148 in a faceless manner , as per the schem e framed vide notification
dated 29-3-2022, cannot be applied to the case of search and seizure under section 132, where the
Jurisdictional Assessing Officer (JAO) is required to record his satisfaction on the basis of the material for
affirmation of opinion in an honest and bona fide  manner . [Para 25]
■ There is substance in the submission of the revenue that recording of satisfaction by the Assessing Officer
on a perusal of the information received by him as a result of search and seizure operation under section
132, requires application of human mind, inasmuch as, reasons affirmed on the part of the Satisfaction
Note may also become subject matter of scrutiny by the Court in a case of challenge, where the Court in12/16/25, 2:19 PM
2/10
exercise of power of judicial review may examine as to whether they are actuated by mala fides or passed
on extraneous or irrelevant considerations. [Para 26]
■ From the above, by reading all the relevant provisions of the Act as also the notification dated 29-3-2022
issued by the Central Government framing scheme for "E-Assessment of Income Escaping Assessment"
under sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 151A, it is concluded that the challenge to the notice under
section 148 dated 22-3-2024 for assessment year 2021-22 on the sole premise that the said notice could
have been issued only through autom ated allocation in faceless manner and not by Jurisdictional
Assessing Of ficer (JAO), cannot be sustained. [Para 28]
■ The submission of the assessee that the Jurisdictional Assessing Officer (JAO) was not competent to issue
the impugned notice under section 148 in a case of search and seizure under section 132, are not
convincing. [Para 29]
■ Moreover , section 151A  contemplates framing of the scheme by the Central Government by notification
in the official Gazette, even for the purpose of issuance of notice under section 148 in the case of re-
assessment or sanction for issue of such notice under section 151, with the aim to impart greater
efficiency , transparency and accountability by eliminating the interface between the income tax authority
and the assessee or any other person to the extent technologically feasible. [Para 30]
■ The feasibility of implying technology for the process, therefore, would be relevant. There may be a
situation, where a scheme may be framed by the Central Government for issuance of the notice under
section 148 even in the case of Search and Seizure under section 132, so as to meet out the expectations of
the legislature under section 151A, to impart greater efficiency , transparency and accountability by
applying artificial intelligence, technological innovations, etc., but as of now, from a careful reading of the
notification dated 29-3-2022, along with the statutory provisions, it is found that the aforesaid notification
does not cover a case where notice under section 148 is issued by the Jurisdictional Assessing Officer
(JAO) the information received by him in the matter of search and seizure under section 132, or
requisitioned under section 132A. [Para 31]
■ The challenge to the impugned notice on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the Jurisdictional Assessing
Authority is, accordingly , turned down. [Para 32]
■ However , it is further noted that two Satisfaction Notes for assessment years 2021-22 and 2022-23 dated
22-3-2024 and 7-3-2024 have been supplied to the assessee in the compilation submitted on behalf of the
revenue. It was also placed by the revenue that after issuance of the impugned notice under section 148,
the instant case has proceeded to the stage of issuance of the notice under section 142(1). The said notice
has been issued by the Verification Unit of the Faceless Assessment Centre. [Para 33]
■ Therefore, it is found fit and proper to dispose of the present petitions with the observation that the
assessees may pursue his remedy matter s before the Competent Authority and may ask for virtual hearing,
if the need be, to participate in the proceedings, which have to be brought to their logical end, strictly in
accordance with law . [Para 34]
