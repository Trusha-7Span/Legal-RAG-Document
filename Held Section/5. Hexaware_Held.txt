Whether TOLA  is applicable for Asses sment Year 2015-2016 and whether any notice issued under section
148 of the Act after 31st March 2021 will travel back to the original date?
■ For assessment year 2015-2016 the provisions of TOLA  are not applicable. Therefore, there is no question
of revenue relying on TOLA  to justify the impugned notice under section 148 as being within the period
of limitation. [Para 21]
■ No any notice issued under section 148 after 31st March, 2021, will travel back  to the original date. [Para
23]
■ The first proviso to section 149 provides that no notice under section 148 shall  be issued at any point of
time in a case for a relevant assessment year beginning on or before the 1st day of April, 2021, if a notice
under section 148 could not have been issued at that time on account of being beyond the time limit
specified under the provision of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of this section, as it stood immediately
before the commencement of the Financ e Act, 2021. The term 'at that time' in the first proviso refers to the
date on which notice under section 148 is to be issued by the Assessing Officer. The term 'at that time' has
to refer to the term 'at any time' used earlier in the said proviso. The reference to 'at any time' is to the date
of the notice to be issued by the Assessing Officer and, therefore, the term 'at that time' would also refer to
the said date. On the said date, if a notice could not have been issued under the erstwhile provision of
section 149(1)( b) for any assessment year beginning on or before the 1st day of April, 2021, the notice
cannot be issued even under the new provisions. [Para 24]
■ Section 149(1)( b) of the erstwhile provisions provided a time limit of six years from the end of the
relevant assessment year for issuing notice under section 148. For the relevant assessment year, being
assessment year 2015-2016, 6th year expired on 31st March, 2022. The notice under section 148, in the
instant case, is issued on 27th August, 2022, i.e., clearly beyond the period of limitation prescribed in
section 149 read with the first proviso to the said section. [Para 25]
■ The purpose of the first proviso to section 149 is consistent with the stated object of the government to
make prospective amendments in the Act. Accordingly , the proviso provides that up to assessment year12/16/25, 12:00 PM
3/45
2021-2022 (period before the amendment), the period of limitation as prescribed in the erstwhile
provisions of section 149(1)( b) would be applicable and only from assessment year 2022-2023, the period
of ten years as provided in section 149(1)( b), would be applicable. The submission of the revenue to
interpret the first proviso to section 149 to be applicable only for assessment years 2013-2014 and 2014-
2015, i.e., for assessment years where the period of limitation had already expired on 1st April, 2021 is
not sustainable. The interpretation canvassed by the Revenue is clearly contrar y to the plain language of
the proviso. When the language in the statute is clear , it has to be so interpreted  and there is no scope for
interpreting the provision on any other basis. The taxing statue should be strictly construed. [Para 26]
■ The interpretation as canvassed by the revenue would render the first proviso  to section 149 redundant
and otiose. The time limit to issue notice under section 148 had already expired on 1st April, 2021, for
assessment years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, when section 148 was amended. Therefore, reopening for
assessment years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 had already been barred by limitation on 1st April, 2021.
Accordingly , the extended period of ten years as provided in section 149(1)( b) would not have been
applicable to assessment years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015,  de hors the proviso. It is a settled principle of
law that when limitation has already expired, it cannot be revived by way of a subsequent amendment
and, hence, for assessment years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 proviso to section 149 was not required.
Hence, to give meaning to the proviso it has to be interpreted to be applicable for assessment years up to
2021-2022. The interpretation canvassed by the revenue would render the following parts of the proviso
redundant -
(i) 'at any time' in the first line of the proviso; (ii) 'beginning on or before 1st day of April, 2021,' in the
second line of the proviso. ( iii) 'at that time' in the fourth line of the proviso.
 If this court have to give effect to the interpretation suggested by the revenue, then the proviso
would have read as under :
 "Provided that no notice under section 148 shall be issued at any time in a case for the relevant
assessment year beginning on or before 1st day of April, 2021, if a notice under section 148 or
section 153A  or section 153C could not have been issued at that time [on 1st day of April, 2021] on
account of being beyond the time limit specified under the provisions of clause (b) of sub-section
(1) of this section or section 153A  or section 153C, as the case may be, as they stood immediately
before the commencement of the Financ e Act, 2021; OR provided that no notice under section 148
shall be issued at any time in a case for the relevant assessment year beginning on or before 1st day
of April, 2021, if a notice under section  148 or section 153A  or section 153C could not have been
issued at that time [on 1st day of April, 2021] on account of being beyond the time limit specified
under the provisions of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of this section or section 153A  or section 153C,
as the case may be, as they stood immediately before the commencement of the Finance Act,
2021". [Para 27]
■ Section has to be interpreted so as to give meaning to all the words/phrases used in the section and it
should not be interpreted in such a way so as to render any part or phrase in the section otiose. As stated
foresaid, if the interpretation canvassed by the revenue is to be accepted then, not only various parts of the
section would be rendered otiose, one would have to also substitute one phrase with another phrase in the
said section, which is clearly not permissible in law . [Para 28]
Whether the notice dated 27th August 2022 issued under section 148 of the Act is barred by limitation as
per the first proviso to section 149 of the Act?
■ It was submitted on behalf of revenue that the period of limitation for the purposes of section 149 has to
be seen with respect to the original notice under section 148 which was issued to petitioner on 8th April,
2021 and as the said notice was issue d within the period of six years from  the end of the relevant
assessment year, which was expiring on 31st March, 2022, the reassessment proceedings are within the
period of limitation prescribed in section  149. It is not acceptable. Section 149 sets out, inter alia, the time
limit for issuing notice under section 148. Apart from the period of limitation set out in the said Section,
the first proviso lays down a further restriction on the issue of a notice under section 148. The period of
limitation as well as the said further restriction is framed/provided in respect of a notice under 148 and not
for a notice under section 148A. The notice dated 8th April, 2021, which though originally issued as a
notice under section 148 of the Act, (under the provisions of the Act prior to the amendments made by the
Finance Act, 2021), has now been treated as a notice issued under section 148A( b). Once the notice dated12/16/25, 12:00 PM
4/45
8th April, 2021, has been treated as having been issued under section 148A( b), the said notice is no longer
relevant for the purpose of determinin g the period of limitation prescribed under section 149 or the
restriction as per the first proviso below Section 149. Therefore, for considering the restriction on issue of
a notice under section 148 prescribed in the first proviso to section 149, the fresh/presently impugned
notice dated 27th August, 2022 issued under section 148 is required to be considered. The said notice is
admittedly beyond the erstwhile period of limitation of six years prescribed by the Act prior to its
amendment by the Finance Act, 2021. For the assessment year 2015-2016, the erstwhile time limit of six
years expired on 31st March, 2022 and, the impugned notice under section 148 has been issued on 27th
August, 2022 and, therefore, the impugned notice dated 27th August, 2022 is barred by the restriction of
the first proviso to section 149. [Para 29]
■ With respect to applicability of the fifth proviso and the sixth proviso to section 149(1)( b) for extension of
limitation for issuing the notice under section 148, fifth and sixth provisos are only applicable with
respect to the period of limitation prescribed in section 149(1) i.e., three years or ten years, as the case
may be. Fifth proviso or sixth proviso extend limitation for issuing notice under section 149, however , the
first proviso is an exception to the period of limitation and provides for a restriction on the notices under
section 148 being issued for assessment years up to 2021-22 beyond a certain date. Therefore, the way the
section would operate, is first to decide whether a notice issued under section 148 is within the period of
limitation in terms of section 149(1)( a) or (b). To decide whether the notice is within the period of
limitation under section 149(1)( a) or (b), the extension of time as per the fifth and/or sixth proviso would
be considered. Once, the notice is otherwise within the period of limitation, thereafter one has to see
whether the said time limit is within the restriction provided in the first provi so or not. If the notice is
beyond the restriction period, the notice is invalid. The fifth and/or the sixth proviso cannot apply at this
stage to extend the period of restriction as per the first proviso. Hence, if a notice is not within the time
prescribed under the first proviso to section 149(1), then such period cannot be extended by fifth proviso
and sixth proviso. only applicable with respect to the period of limitation prescribed in section 149(1) i.e.,
three years or ten years, as the case may be. Fifth proviso or sixth proviso extend limitation for issuing
notice under section 149, however , the first proviso is an exception to the period of limitation and
provides for a restriction on the notices under section 148 being issued for assessment years upto 2021-22
beyond a certain date. Therefore, the way the Section would operate, is first to decide whether a notice
issued under section 148 is within the period of limitation in terms of section 149(1)( a) or (b). To decide
whether the notice is within the period of limitation under section 149(1)( a) or (b), the extension of time
as per the fifth and/or sixth proviso would be considered. Once, the notice is otherwise within the period
of limitation, thereafter one has to see whether the said time limit is within the restriction provided in the
first proviso or not. If the notice is beyond the restriction period, the notice is invalid. The fifth and/or the
sixth proviso cannot apply at this stage to extend the period of restriction as per the first proviso. Hence, if
a notice is not within the time prescribed under the first proviso to section 149(1), then such period cannot
be extended by fifth proviso and sixth proviso. Even if the fifth and sixth  provisos are held to be
applicable, the impugned notice would still be beyond the period of limitation.  The fifth proviso extends
limitation with respect to the time or extended time allowed to an assessee as per the show cause notice
issued under section 148A( b) or the period, during which the proceeding under section 148A  are stayed
by an order of injunction by any court. Hence, in the instant case, in view of the fifth proviso, the period
to be excluded would be counted from 25th May, 2022, i.e., the date on which the show cause notice was
issued under section 148A( b) by respondent No. 1. Further , the time period from 29th June, 2022 up to
4th July, 2022, cannot be excluded as the same was not based on any extension sought by petitioner , but at
the behest of respondent no. 1. Even if the same was to be excluded, still it will mean further exclusion of
5 days. Considering the said excluded period as well, the impugned notice dated 27th August, 2022, is
still beyond limitation. The fact that the original notice dated 8th April, 2021, issued under section 148,
was stayed by this Court on 3rd August, 2021, and its stay came to an end on 29th March, 2022, on
account of the decision of this Court, will not be relevant for providing extension as per the fifth proviso.
The fifth proviso provides for extension for the period during which the proceeding under section 148A  is
stayed. The original stay granted by this Court was not with respect to the proceeding under section 148A,
but with respect to the proceeding initiated as per the erstwhile provision of section 148 and, hence, such
stay would not extend the period of limitation as per the fifth proviso to section 149. The question of
applicability of the sixth proviso does not arise on the facts of the present case. [Para 30]
Whether the impugned notice dated 27th August 2022 is invalid and bad in law as the same has been
issued without a DIN?12/16/25, 12:00 PM
5/45
■ Admittedly there is no DIN mentioned.  It is petitioner's case that the notice is invalid and bad in law in
view of the Circular No. 19 of 2019 dated 14th August, 2019, issued by CBDT . The reason is firstly , the
intimation letter refers to a DIN with respect to some notice under section 148 dated 26th August, 2022.
The impugned notice issued to petitione r is dated 27th August, 2022 and not 26th August, 2022, for which
the DIN is generated. Secondly , the procedure prescribed in Circular No. 19 of 2019 dated 14th August,
2019, for non-mention of DIN in case letter/notice/order has not been complied with by respondent no. 1.
It is settled that if DIN is not mentioned in the letter/notice/order , the reason for not mentioning the DIN
and the approval from specified autho rity for issuing such letter/notice/order without DIN has to be
obtained and mentioned in such letter/notice/order . In the present case, in the impugned notice dated 27th
August, 2022, no such reference is there. Therefore, the impugned notice dated 27th August, 2022, issued
under section 148 is invalid and bad in law as the same has been issued without a DIN. [Para 31]
Whether the impugned notice dated 27th August 2022 is invalid and bad in law being issued by the JAO as
the same was not in accordance with section 151A  of the Act?
■ Section 151A  gives the power to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to notify the scheme for (i)
the purpose of assessment, reassessment or recomputation under section 147; or (ii) issuance of notice
under section 148; or (iii) conducting of inquiry or issuance of show cause notice or passing of order
under section 148A; or (iv) sanction for issuance of notice under section 151; so as to impart greater
efficiency , transparency and accountabil ity by inter alia eliminating the interface between the Income-tax
Authorities and assessee. Sub-section 3 of section 151A  also provides that every notification issued under
sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 151A  shall be laid before each House of Parliament. In exercise of the
powers conferred by sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 151A  of the Act, CBDT  issued a notification dated
29th March, 2022 [Notification No. 18/2022/F . No. 370142/16/2022-TPL  and formulated a Scheme. The
Scheme provides that - (a) the assessment, reassessment or recomputation under section 147; (b) and the
issuance of notice under section 148 shall be through automated allocation, in accordance with risk
management strategy formulated by the Board as referred to in section 148 Act for issuance of notice and
in a faceless manner , to the extent provided in section 144B with reference to making assessment or
reassessment of total income or loss of assessee. The impugned notice dated 27th August, 2022 has been
issued by respondent No. 1 (JAO) and not by the NFAC, which is not in accordance with the aforesaid
Scheme. [Para 32]
■ The guideline dated 1st August, 2022, relied upon by the Revenue is not applicable because these
guidelines are internal guidelines as is clear from the endorsement on the first page of the guideline -
"Confidential For Departmental Circula tion Only". The said guidelines are not issued under section 119.
Any such guideline issued by the CBDT  is not binding on petitioner . Further the said guideline is also not
binding on respondent No. 1 as they are contrary to the provisions of the Act and the Scheme framed
under section 151A. The provisions of the Act cannot be relied upon by the Revenue to reject an
application for compounding filed by an assessee. Guidelines are subordinate to the principal Act or rules,
it cannot restrict or override the application of specific provisions enacted by legislature. The guidelines
cannot travel beyond the scope of the powers conferred by the Act or the rules. The guidelines do not deal
with or even refer to the Scheme dated 29th March, 2022, framed by the Govern ment under section 151A.
Section 151A(3) of the Act provides that the Scheme so framed is required to be laid before each House of
the Parliament. Therefore, the Scheme dated 29th March, 2022, under section 151A, which has also been
laid before the Parliament, would be binding on the Revenue and the guideline dated 1st August, 2022,
cannot supersede the Scheme and if it provides anything to the contrary to the said Scheme, then the same
is required to be treated as invalid and bad in law . [Para 33]
■ As regards ITBA  step-by-step document No. 2 regarding issuance of notice under section 148 relied upon
by Revenue, an internal document canno t depart from the explicit statutory provisions of, or supersede the
Scheme framed by the Government under section 151A  which scheme is also placed before both the
Houses of Parliament as per section 151A(3). This is specially the case when the document does not even
consider or even refer to the Scheme. Further, the said document is clearly intended to be a manual/guide
as to how to use the Income-tax Depar tment's portal, and does not even claim to be a statement of the
revenue's position/stand on the issue in question. The observations with respect to the guidelines dated 1st
August, 2022, relied upon by the revenue will equally be applicable here. [Para 34]
■ Further , there is no question of concurrent jurisdiction of the JAO and the FAO for issuance of notice
under section 148 or even for passing assessment or reassessment order . When specific jurisdiction has12/16/25, 12:00 PM
6/45
been assigned to either the JAO or the FAO in the Scheme dated 29th March, 2022, then it is to the
exclusion of the other . To take any other view in the matter , would not only result in chaos but also render
the whole faceless proceedings redundant. If the argument of revenue is to be accepted, then even when
notices are issued by the FAO, it would  be open to an assessee to make submission before the JAO and
vice versa,  which is clearly not contemplated in the Act. Therefore, there is no question of concurrent
jurisdiction of both FAO or the JAO with respect to the issuance of notice unde r section 148. The scheme
dated 29th March, 2022, in paragraph 3 clearly provides that the issuance of notice "shall be through
automated allocation" which means that the same is mandatory and is required to be followed by the
Department and does not give any discretion to the Department to choose whether to follow it or not. That
automated allocation is defined in paragraph 2(b) of the Scheme to mean an algorithm for randomised
allocation of cases by using suitable technological  tools including artificial intelligence and machine
learning with a view to optimise the use of resources. Therefore, it means that the case can be allocated
randomly to any officer who would then have jurisdiction to issue the notice under section 148. It is not
the case of respondent No. 1 that respondent No. 1 was the random officer who had been allocated
jurisdiction. [Para 35]
■ With respect to the arguments of the revenue, i.e., the notification dated 29th March, 2022, provides that
the scheme so framed is applicable only 'to the extent' provided in section 144B and section 144B does
not refer to issuance of notice under section 148 and hence, the notice cannot be issued by the FAO as per
the said scheme. Section 151A  itself contemplates formulation of Scheme for both assessment,
reassessment or recomputation under section 147 as well as for issuance of notice under section 148.
Therefore, the Scheme framed by the CBDT , which covers both the aforesaid aspect of the provisions of
section 151A  cannot be said to be applic able only for one aspect, i.e., proceedings post the issue of notice
under section 148 being assessment, reassessment or recomputation under sectio n 147 and inapplicable to
the issuance of notice under section 148. The Scheme is clearly applicable for issuance of notice under
section 148 and accordingly , it is only the FAO which can issue the notice under section 148 and not the
JAO. The argument advanced by respondent would render clause 3(b) of the Scheme otiose and to be
ignored or contravened, as according to respondent, even though the Scheme  specifically provides for
issuance of notice under section 148 in a faceless manner , no notice is required to be issued under section
148 in a faceless manner . In such a situation, not only clause 3(b) but also the first two lines below clause
3(b) would be otiose, as it deals with the aspect of issuance of notice under section 148. Respondents,
being an authority subordinate to the CBDT , cannot argue that the Scheme framed by the CBDT , and
which has been laid before both House of Parliament is partly otiose and inapplicable. The argument
advanced by respondent expressly makes clause 3(b) otiose and impliedly makes the whole Scheme
otiose. If clause 3(b) of the Scheme is not applicable, then only clause 3(a) of the Scheme remains. What
is covered in clause 3(a) of the Scheme is already provided in section 144B(1) which section provides for
faceless assessment, and covers assessment, reassessment or recomputation under section 147. Therefore,
if revenue's arguments are to be accepted, there is no purpose of framing a Scheme only for clause 3(a)
which is in any event already covered under faceless assessment regime in section 144B. The argument of
respondent, therefore, renders the whole Scheme redundant. An argument which renders the whole
Scheme otiose cannot be accepted as correct interpretation of the Scheme. The phrase "to the extent
provided in section 144B" in the scheme is with reference to only making assessment or reassessment or
total income or loss of assessee. Therefore, for the purposes of making assessment or reassessment, the
provisions of section 144B would be applicable as no such manner for reassessment is separately
provided in the Scheme. For issuing notice, the term "to the extent provided in section 144B is not
relevant. The Scheme provides that the notice under section 148 shall be issued through automated
allocation, in accordance with risk management strategy formulated by the Board as referred to in section
148 and in a faceless manner . Therefore, "to the extent provided in section 144B" does not go with
issuance of notice and is applicable only with reference to assessment or reassessment. The phrase "to the
extent provided in section 144B" would mean that the restriction provided in section 144B, such as
keeping the International Tax Jurisdiction or Central Circle Jurisdiction out of the ambit of section 144B
would also apply under the Scheme. Further the exceptions provided in sub-sections (7) and (8) of section
144B of the Act would also be applicable to the Scheme. [Para 36]
■ When an authority acts contrary to law, the said act of the Authority is required to be quashed and set
aside as invalid and bad in law and the person seeking to quash such an action is not required to establish
prejudice from the said Act. An act which is done by an authority contrary to the provisions of the statute,
itself causes prejudice to assessee. All assessees are entitled to be assessed as per law and by following the12/16/25, 12:00 PM
7/45
procedure prescribed by law. Therefore, when the Income-tax Authority proposes to take action against an
assessee without following the due process of law, the said action itself results in a prejudice to assessee.
Therefore, there is no question of petitioner having to prove further prejudice before arguing the invalidity
of the notice. [Para 37]
■ With respect to the Office Memorandum dated 20th February , 2023, the said Office Memorandum merely
contains the comments of the Revenue issued with the approval of Member (L&S) CBDT  and the said
Office Memorandum is not in the nature of a guideline or instruction issued under section 119 so as to
have any binding effect on the revenue. Moreover , the arguments advanced by the Revenue on the said
Office Memorandum dated 20th February , 2023, is clearly contrary to the provisions of the Act as well as
the Scheme dated 29th March, 2022 and the same are dealt with as under -
(i) It is erroneously stated in paragraph 3 of the Office Memorandum that "The scheme clearly lays
down that the issuance of notice under section 148 has to be through automation in accordance with
the risk management strategy referred to in section 148." The issuance of notice is not through
automation but through "automated allocation". The term "automated allocation" is defined in
clause 2(1)( b) of the said Scheme to mean random allocation of cases to Assessing Officers.
Therefore, it is clear that the Assessing Officer are randomly selected to handle a case and it is not
merely a case where notice is sought to be issued through automation.
(ii) It is further erroneously stated in paragraph 3 of the Office Memorandum that "To this end, as
provided in the section 148 of the Act, the Directorate of Systems randomly selects a number of
cases based on the criteria of Risk Management Strategy ." The term 'randomly' is further used at
numerous other places in the Office Memorandum with respect to selection of cases for
consideration/issuance of notice unde r section 148. Respondent is clearly incorrect in its
understanding of the said Scheme as the reference to random in the said Scheme is reference to
selection of Assessing Officer at random and not selection of section 148 cases as random. If the
cases for issuance of notice under section 148 are selected based on criteria of the risk management
strategy , then, obviously , the same are not randomly selected. The term 'randomly' by definition
mean something which is chosen by chance rather than according to a plan. Therefore, if the cases
are chosen based on risk management strategy , they certainly cannot be said to be random. The
Computer/System cannot select cases on random but selection can be based on certain well defined
criteria. Hence, the argument of respondents is clearly unsustainable. If the case of respondent is
that the applicability of section 148 is on random basis, then the provision of section 148 itself
would become contrary to article 14 of the Constitution of India as being arbitrary and
unreasonable. Randomly selecting cases for reopening without there being any basis or criteria
would mean that the section is applied by the revenue in an arbitrary and unreasonable manner . The
word 'random' is used in clause 2(1)( b) of the said Scheme in the definition of "automated
allocation". "Automated allocation" is defined in the said clause to mean "an algorithm for
randomised allocation of cases….. ". The term 'random', in our view , has been used in the context
of assigning the case to a random Asses sing Officer, i.e., an Assessing Officer would be random ly
chosen by the system to handle a particu lar case. The term 'random' is not used for selection of case
for issuance of notice under section 148 as has been alleged by the Revenue in the Office
Memorandum. Further , in paragraph 3.2 of the Office Memorandum, with respect to the
reassessment proceedings, the reference to 'random allocation' has correctly been made as random
allocation of cases to the Assessment Units by the National Faceless Assessment Centre. When
random allocation is with reference to officer for reassessment then the same would equally apply
for issuance of notice under section 148.
(iii) The conclusion at the bottom of page 2 in paragraph 3 of the Office Memorandum that "Therefore,
as provided in the scheme the notice under section 148 is issued on automated allocation of cases to
the Assessing Officer based on the risk management criteria " is also factually incorrect and on the
basis of incorrect interpretation of the Scheme. Clause 2(1)( b) of the Scheme defined 'automated
allocation' to mean 'an algorithm for randomised allocation of cases by using suitable technological
tools, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, with a view to optimise the use of
resources'. The said definition does not provide that the automated allocation of case to the
Assessing Officer is based on the risk management criteria. The reference to risk management
criteria in clause 3 of the Scheme is to the effect that the notice under section 148 should be in
accordance with the risk management strategy formulated by the board which is in accordance with12/16/25, 12:00 PM
8/45
Explanation 1 to section 148. The revenue is misinterpreting the scheme, perhaps to cover its
deficiency of not following the scheme for issuing notice under section 148.
(iv) In paragraph 3.1 of the Office Memorandum, it is stated that the case is selected prior to issuance of
notice are decided on the basis of an algorithm as per risk management strategy and are, therefore,
randomly selected. It is further stated that these cases are 'flagged' to the JAO by the Directorate of
Systems and the JAO does not have any control over the process. It is further stated that the JAO
has no way of predicting or determining beforehand whether the case will be 'flagged' by the
system. The contention of the revenue is that only cases which are 'flagged' by the system as per the
risk management strategy formulated by CBDT  can be considered by the Assessing Officer for
reopening, however , in clause (i) in the Explanation 1 to section 148, the term "flagged" has been
deleted by the Finance Act, 2022, with effect from 1st April, 2022. In any case,  whether only cases
which are flagged can be reopened or not is not relevant to decide the scope of the Scheme framed
under section 151A, which required the notice under section 148 to be issued on the basis of
random allocation and in a faceless manner .
(v) The revenue has wrongly contended in paragraph 3.1 of the Office Memorandum that "Therefore,
whether JAO or NFAC should issue such notice is decided by administration keeping in mind the
end result of natural justice to the assessees as well as completion of required procedure in a
reasonable time. "There is no such power given to the administration under either section 151A  or
under the said Scheme. The Scheme is clear and categorical that notice under section 148 shall be
issued through automated allocation and in a faceless manner . Therefore, the argument of the
revenue is clearly contrary to the provisions of the scheme.
(vi) In paragraph 3.3 of the Office Memorandum, it is again erroneously stated that "Here it is pertinent
to note that the said notification does not state whether the notices to be issued by the NFAC or the
Jurisdictional Assessing Officer ("JAO ")……It states that issuance of notice under section 148
shall be through automated allocation in accordance with the risk management strategy and that the
assessment shall be in faceless manner  to the extent provided in section 144B." The Scheme is
categoric as stated aforesaid that the notice under section 148 shall be issued through automated
allocation and in a faceless manner . The Scheme clearly provides that the notice under section 148
is required to be issued by NFAC and not the JAO. Further , unlike as canvassed by Revenue that
only the assessment shall be in faceless manner , the Scheme is very clear that both the issuance of
notice and assessment shall be in faceless manner .
(vii) In paragraph 5 of the Office Memorandum, a completely unsustainable and illogical submission has
been made that section 151A  takes into account that procedures may be modified under the Act or
laid out taking into account the technological  feasibility at the time. Reading the said Scheme along
with section 151A  makes it clear that neither the section or the Scheme speak about the detailed
specifics of the procedure to be followed therein. This argument of the revenue is clearly contrary
to the Scheme as the Scheme is very specific to provide, inter alia, that the issuance of notice under
section 148 shall be through automated location and in a faceless manner . Therefore, the Scheme is
mandatory and provides the specification as to how the notice has to be issued. Further the
argument of the Revenue that section 151A  takes into account that the procedure may be modified
under the Act is without appreciating that if the procedure is required to be modified then the same
would require modification of the notifie d Scheme. It is not open to the Revenue to refuse to follow
the Scheme as the Scheme is clearly mandatory and is required to be followed by all Assessing
Officers.
(viii) The argument of the revenue in paragraph 5.1 of the Office Memorandum that the Section and
Scheme have left it to the administration to device and modify procedures with time while
remaining confined to the principles laid down in the said Section and Scheme, is without
appreciating that one of the main principles laid down in the Scheme is that the notice under section
148 is required to be issued through automated allocation and in a faceless manner . There is no
leeway given on the said aspect and, therefore, there is no question of the administration to device
and modify procedures with respect to the issuance of notice. [Para 38]
Whether the issues raised in the impugned order show an alleged escapement of income represented in the
form of an asset or expenditure in respect of transaction in relation to an event or an entry in the books of
account as required in section 149(1)( b) of the Act?12/16/25, 12:00 PM

■ It is petitioner's case that the issues raise d in the impugned initial notice and the impugned order pertain to
correct claim of deduction/allowances or the expenditure incurred. There is also no allegation regarding
income escaping tax on account of any undisclosed asset. In the impugned order , the Assessing Officer
has restricted the escapement of income only with regard to Rs. 6.54 crores on the claim of deduction
under section 80JJAA  and disallowance of excess claim of Forex loss of Rs. 6.90 crores. On the Forex
loss, respondent has prima facie  accepted the contentions of petitioner that there was a Forex loss.
Therefore, the same cannot be justified as an escapement of income. Respondent No. 1 has also accepted
that the transactions of CPBSL  have been duly incorporated in the accounts of petitioner and that no
deduction is claimed in respect of the deduction allowed under section 10AA. None of the issues raised in
the impugned order show an alleged escapement of income represented in the form of asset as required in
section 149(1)( b). [Para 40]
■ As regards the claim of deduction under section 80JJAA, an issue of correctness of claim of deduction
under Chapter VI, cannot be covered by section 149(1)( b). Section 149(1)( b) prescribes that escaped
income must be represented in the form of (i) an asset; (ii) expenditure in respect of a transaction or in
relation to an event; (iii) an entry in the books of account. The question of a correctness of the claim of
deduction under section 80JJAA  cannot represent escapement of income in the form of an asset. The term
'asset' is defined in Explanation  to section 149 to include immovable property being land or building or
both, shares and securities, loans and advances, deposit in bank account. The present case does not fall in
any of the types of the assets as mentioned above. Further , the alleged claim of disallowance of deduction
also can never fall under the category of either clause (b) or clause (c) as it is neither a case of expenditure
in relation to an event nor a case of an entry in the books of account as no entries are passed in the books
of account for claiming a deduction under the provisions of the Act. On this ground also the impugned
notice will be invalid. [Para 41]
Whether respondent no. 1 has proposed to reopen on the basis of change of opinion and if it is
permissible?
■ As regards another issue that respondent No. 1 has no power to review his own assessment when the same
information was provided and considered by him during the original assessment proceedings. There
cannot be a reopening based on a change of opinion. The claim of deduction under section 80JJAA  was
made by petitioner in the return of income and petitioner had filed Form 10DA  being the report of the
Chartered Accountant. In the said Form, a note has been filed along with Form 10DA  and it has
specifically been submitted by petitioner that software development activity constitutes
'manufacture/production of article or thing'. The claim of deduction under section 80JJAA  was also
disclosed in the Tax Audit Report filed by petitioner along with the return of income. Further , during the
assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer had issued a notice dated 5th October , 2017, asking for
details of deduction claimed under Chapter VI of the Act. Petitioner  vide a letter dated 13th November ,
2017, gave the details of deduction claimed under Chapter VI of the Act along with supporting
documents. The Assessing Officer has passed the assessment order dated 30th November , 2017 allowing
the claim of deduction under section 80JJAA. The claim for deduction under section 80JJAA  was allowed
by the Assessing Officer in the previous years as well. Hence, the present case is clearly a case of change
of opinion or review of the original assessment order which is not permissible even under the new
provisions. The concept of change of opinion being an in-built test to check abuse of power by the
Assessing Officer and the Assessing Officer having allowed the claim of deduction under section 80JJAA
in the assessment order , now to disallow the same is based on a clear change of opinion. Reassessment
proceedings initiated on the basis of a mere change of opinion is invalid and without jurisdiction. On this
ground also the impugned notice issued under section 148 has to be quashed and set aside. [Para 42]
When the claim of deduction under section 80JJAA  of the Act has been consistently allowed in favour of
petitioner by the Assessing Officers/Appellate Authorities in the earlier years, can the Assessing Officer
have a belief that there is escapement of income?
■ Section 80JJA(1) provides that where the gross total income of an assessee  to whom section 44AB
applies, includes any profits and gains derived from business, there shall, subject to the conditions
specified in sub-section (2), be allowed a deduction of an amount equal to thirty per cent of additional
employee cost incurred in the course of such business in the previous year, for three assessment years
including the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which such employment is provided. The
fact that the claim of deduction under section 80JJAA  has been allowed to petitioner consistently since12/16/25, 12:00 PM
10/45
assessment year 2010-201 1 is not disputed. Therefore, respondent no. 1 cannot allege that income
chargeable to tax has escaped assessment on account of such claim being allowed for assessment year
2015-2016 when such claim stands allowed for earlier years on identical facts, i.e., with respect to the
same business activity . [Para 44]
■ As regards to submission of revenue that the merits of the claim of deduction under section 80JJAA
cannot be urged/ar gued in the present writ petition and petitioner has an alternate remedy to argue the
merits of the case before the Assessing Officer, petitioner is not arguing the merits of deduction under
section 80JJAA. It is the submission of petitioner that the jurisdictional conditions prescribed under
sections 147, 148, 148A, 149, 151, and 151A  have not been fulfilled by respon dent no. 1 before issuing
the impugned notice under section 148. As jurisdictional conditions are not fulfilled by respondent no. 1,
the impugned notice can be challenged by petitioner before this court. The respondent has failed to
appreciate that petitioner has not argued the case on the merits but merely submitted that on merits
deduction under section 80JJAA  has already been allowed in the earlier assessment years, i.e., assessment
years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 and the deduction in the assessment year 2015-2016 is only
consequential as the eligibility to claim deduction was in the assessment year 2013-2014 and, therefore,
there is no question of reopening the assessment for the relevant assessment to disallow the deduction
under section 80JJAA. [Para 45]
